  Vagisha got involved with proteomics at UC San Diego working with Prof. Vineet Bafna. She has worked on Mass Spectrometry pipelines for the Aebersold group at ISB and developed data management systems at UW Proteomics Resource. She joined the Skyline team in October 2011, focusing on tools that help researchers get work done.

- **David Shteynberg** - Developer  
  David spent over 20 years at the Institute for Systems Biology, starting with microarray robotics in Dr. Leroy Hood's lab and shifting to computational mass spectrometry by 2004. He has developed novel computational algorithms including iProphet and PTMProphet, and is currently advancing machine-learning AI for peptide spectrum prediction and PTM identification in DIA data.

- **[Nicholas Shulman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicholas-shulman-19b7bb/)** - Developer  
  Nick worked at Microsoft on the Access team from 1995-2000, then joined Westside Corporation and later BEA Systems creating development environments.
