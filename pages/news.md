## Recent News

### 2025
- 2025 July 7-11 -- Weeklong [Skyline Course](https://skyline.ms/project/home/software/Skyline/events/2025%20UW%20Course/begin.view) in Seattle! Great speakers and participation in our yearly course.
- 2025 July 1 -- The Mag-Net paper is out in Nature Communications. [Enrichment of extracellular vesicles using Mag-Net for the analysis of the plasma proteome](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-60595-7). This started as a pandemic side project of Chris Wu's and we now have many variants on the idea. We've now put 1000s of plasma samples through this protocol and we know others have too. This has been a game changer for how we view biofluid proteomics.
- 2025 July 1 -- New Publication in Nature Methods. [A transformer model for de novo sequencing of data-independent acquisition mass spectrometry data](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-025-02718-y). Great collaborative project pushed by Justin Sanders in the Noble Lab. If you asked me 5 years ago if it would be possible to use a de novo tool on DIA data, I would have thought it would only exist in science fiction. Love being proven wrong.
- 2025 June -- Skyline User Group Meeting at ASMS. Another year and another fantastic user group meeting. We had 10 fastastic talks from colleagues describing how they are using Skyline in their research. See recordings on the [Skyline website](https://skyline.ms/project/home/software/Skyline/events/2025%20User%20Group%20Meeting%20at%20ASMS/begin.view).
