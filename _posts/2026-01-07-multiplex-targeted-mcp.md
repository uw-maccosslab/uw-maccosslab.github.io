Deanna Plubell's paper on [Development of highly multiplex targeted proteomics assays in biofluids using a nominal mass ion trap mass spectrometer](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mcpro.2026.101506) is now published in Molecular & Cellular Proteomics. This work was done during Deanna's postdoc in the lab and was a fantastic collaboration with our Thermo colleagues Phillip Remes, Cristina Jacob, and Lilian Heil, as well as our neurodegeneration collaborators Kathleen Poston and Tom Montine. The paper demonstrates the generation of large-scale targeted assays using the Stellar mass spectrometer, with applications to cerebrospinal fluid and Mag-Net enriched plasma extracellular vesicles for neurodegenerative disease research.
