Excited to see this latest [paper](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jproteome.5c00593) published in JPR. For years we've wanted a simple way to standardize the signal between mass spectrometry instrumentation. Here we use the precision of an intra spectrum ratio to assess the relationship between the reported signal and the number of ions. We use this strategy to assess the improvement in the Orbitrap Astral Zoom over the original and to evaluate the effect of different acquisition strategies. Looking forward to seeing others apply this approach in the evaluation of other instruments. Great work by graduate student Chris Hsu.
