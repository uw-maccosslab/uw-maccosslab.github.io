We hosted our third Skyline webinar of 2025 with over 153 participants joining Michael MacCoss and Nick Shulman on December 11th. The webinar introduced the newest Skyline tutorial on Peak Boundary Imputation for DIA Data.

Mike presented a case for imputing boundaries for missing DIA data, and Nick demonstrated the technique using Skyline. The session concluded with a great Q&A that generated many excellent questions and will lead to more discussion in a future webinar.

The webinar recording, slides, tutorial, and data set are available on the [Skyline Webinar 27 page](https://skyline.ms/project/home/software/Skyline/events/2025%20Webinars/Webinar%2027/begin.view).
