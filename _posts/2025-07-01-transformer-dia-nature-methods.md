New Publication in Nature Methods. [A transformer model for de novo sequencing of data-independent acquisition mass spectrometry data](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-025-02718-y). Great collaborative project pushed by Justin Sanders in the Noble Lab. If you asked me 5 years ago if it would be possible to use a de novo tool on DIA data, I would have thought it would only exist in science fiction. Love being proven wrong.
