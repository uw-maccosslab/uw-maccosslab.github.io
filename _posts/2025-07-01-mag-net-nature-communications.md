The Mag-Net paper is out in Nature Communications. [Enrichment of extracellular vesicles using Mag-Net for the analysis of the plasma proteome](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-60595-7). This started as a pandemic side project of Chris Wu's and we now have many variants on the idea. We've now put 1000s of plasma samples through this protocol and we know others have too. This has been a game changer for how we view biofluid proteomics.
