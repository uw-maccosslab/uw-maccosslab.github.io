## Our Research Focus

The focus of our research is in the development of mass spectrometry and stable isotope-based approaches to improve our understanding of biology on a molecular, cellular, and whole organism level.

*Current research areas include:*

- **New Mass Spectrometry Technologies:** We are working on new methods to improve the sensitivity, speed, precision, accuracy, and dynamic range of quantitative measurements.
- **Improved Sample Preparation:** New biochemical sample preparation methods for the analysis of protein mixtures. We have been working on methods to reduce the cost and improve the robustness of historically challenging sample types.
- **Experimental Design and Quality Control:** We are very interested in quantitative experimental design. We develop novel methods to assess system suitability and data quality.
- **Stable Isotope Methods:** Developing stable isotope methods for studying protein metabolism and analyte quantity
- **Spatial and Tissue Heterogeneity:** We are developing methods for the multiplex analysis of proteins in individual cells, spatial regions, or functional subunits of complex tissue samples.
- **Computational Tools:** Development of computational tools for automated conversion of mass spectrometry data into biologically meaningful results

## Quantitative Proteomics Services

The MacCoss lab offers a number of mass spectrometry based proteomics services.  These range from biofluid proteomics, targeted assay development, etc... For information about these services see [our services page](https://panoramaweb.org/Services/). Email at services[at]maccosslab[dot]org for mroe information

## Nunn Lab

We share lab space and resources with [Brook Nunn's lab](https://www.environmentalproteomics.org/) here in the Department of Genome Sciences. The focus in the Nunn lab is to use mass spectrometry-based proteomics as a tool to understand a variety of environmental questions- from proteins preserved in sediments of the deep sea to the adaptation of bacteria cells to subzero temperatures.

## Support Our Research

The MacCoss lab has developed technologies and software tools that improve protein characterization in health and disease.
