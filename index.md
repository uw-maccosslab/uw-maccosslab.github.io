## Our Research Focus

The focus of our research is in the development of stable isotope and mass spectrometry-based approaches to improve our understanding of biology on a molecular, cellular, and whole organism level.

Current research areas include:

- **Automated Sample Preparation**: Automating biochemical sample preparation methods for the analysis of protein mixtures
- **Stable Isotope Methods**: Developing in vivo stable isotope methods for studying protein metabolism  
- **Dynamic Range Enhancement**: Increasing the dynamic range of liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry for peptide analysis
- **Computational Tools**: Developing computational tools for automated conversion of mass spectrometry data into biologically meaningful results

## Major Software Contributions

### [Skyline](https://skyline.ms)
A freely-available, open-source Windows client application for building Selected Reaction Monitoring (SRM) / Multiple Reaction Monitoring (MRM), Parallel Reaction Monitoring (PRM), DIA/SWATH, and targeted DDA with MS1 quantitative methods and analyzing the resulting mass spectrometer data.

### [Panorama](https://panoramaweb.org)
A freely-available, open-source repository server application designed for targeted mass spectrometry assays. Panorama is a web-based application that provides storage and analysis for Skyline documents.
