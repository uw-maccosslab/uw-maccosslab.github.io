## Our Research Focus

The focus of our research is in the development of stable isotope and mass spectrometry-based approaches to improve our understanding of biology on a molecular, cellular, and whole organism level.

Current research areas include:

- **Automated Sample Preparation**: Automating biochemical sample preparation methods for the analysis of protein mixtures
- **Stable Isotope Methods**: Developing in vivo stable isotope methods for studying protein metabolism  
- **Dynamic Range Enhancement**: Increasing the dynamic range of liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry for peptide analysis
- **Computational Tools**: Developing computational tools for automated conversion of mass spectrometry data into biologically meaningful results

## Quantitative Proteomics Services
The MacCoss lab offers a number of mass spectrometry based proteomics services.  These range from biofluid proteomics, targeted assay development, etc... Some information about these services see [here](https://panoramaweb.org/Services/). Email at services@maccosslab.org for mroe information

## Nunn Lab
We share lab space and resources with [Brook Nunn's lab](https://www.environmentalproteomics.org/) here in the Department of Genome Sciences. The focus in the Nunn lab is to use mass spectrometry-based proteomics as a tool to understand a variety of environmental questions- from proteins preserved in sediments of the deep sea to the adaptation of bacteria cells to subzero temperatures.

## Support Our Research

The MacCoss lab has developed technologies and software tools that improve protein characterization in health and disease.
